# Project Restructuring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete restructuring of the Art Sales Platform project to implement a proper domain-driven design architecture.

## New Project Structure
The project has been restructured according to the following domain-driven design:

```
app/
├── shared/           # Infrastructure (config, exceptions, utilities)
├── auth/            # Authentication domain  
├── artwork/         # Artwork domain
├── user/            # User domain (combining buyer and artist functionality)
├── cart/            # Cart domain
└── order/           # Order domain
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Domain Restructuring
- **auth**: Contains all authentication-related components (signup, login, verification)
- **artwork**: Contains all artwork-related components (creation, listing, management)
- **user**: Combined buyer and artist functionality into a single domain
- **cart**: Contains all cart-related components
- **order**: Contains all order-related components
- **shared**: Contains shared infrastructure (config, exceptions, utilities)

### 2. Component Migration
- Moved all components from generic directories to their appropriate domains
- Consolidated buyer and artist functionality into the user domain
- Removed all generic directories (config, exceptions, utilities, persistence, services, etc.)

### 3. Import Statement Updates
- Updated all import statements to reflect the new domain structure
- Fixed imports from old locations to new domain-based locations
- Ensured all modules can be imported correctly

### 4. Test Suite Updates
- Updated test configuration to use the new shared config location
- Fixed import statements in all test files
- Updated mock configurations to reflect new module locations

## Test Results
- ✅ All 68 tests passing (100% success rate)
- Unit tests: 5/5 passing
- Integration tests: 63/63 passing

## Technologies Used
- Python/Flask backend
- MongoDB database
- Domain-driven design architecture
- Pytest for testing

## Conclusion
The project has been successfully restructured to follow a proper domain-driven design architecture. All components have been moved to their appropriate domains, import statements have been updated, and all tests are passing. The application is now more maintainable and follows modern software engineering practices.
