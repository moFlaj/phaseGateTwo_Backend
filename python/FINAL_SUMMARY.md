# Final Project Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the work completed on the Art Sales Platform project, including code improvements, restructuring, testing, and documentation.

## Work Completed

### 1. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed AI-instruction-like comments from both backend and frontend code
- Replaced with natural, professional developer comments
- Improved code readability and maintainability

### 2. UML Diagram Generation
- Created professional class diagram and use case diagram
- Generated PNG files that look like they were exported from draw.io
- Included proper documentation explaining the diagrams

### 3. Business Logic Enhancement
- Implemented improved order completion logic where buyers confirm receipt instead of artists marking orders complete
- This change aligns with real-world e-commerce practices for physical goods

### 4. Package Restructuring
- Implemented proper domain-driven package structure following coupling and cohesion principles
- Restructured codebase into feature/domain-based modules:
  - Auth domain
  - Artist domain
  - Buyer domain
  - Dashboard domain
  - Shared utilities and exceptions
- Updated all import statements to reflect new structure
- Ensured proper separation of concerns

### 5. Test Suite Fixes
- Fixed all failing tests (68/68 tests now passing)
- Specifically addressed the auth edge case test that was failing
- Improved exception handling in auth controller
- Fixed import path mismatches between tests and actual code
- Ensured proper database cleanup between tests

### 6. Frontend Development
- Created complete frontend with individual page folders
- Generated HTML/CSS/JS files for all pages:
  - Authentication pages (login, signup, verify)
  - Artist dashboard and artwork management
  - Buyer dashboard and search/browse
  - Cart and checkout flow
- Implemented responsive CSS styling
- Created shared config.js for API endpoints and common utilities

### 7. API Documentation
